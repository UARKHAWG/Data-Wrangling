If that doesn't help, then research a solution with google and stackoverflow.

What is a Data Frame?\n","```\n","A data frame is a table or a two-dimensional array-like structure in which each column contains values of one variable and each row contains one set of values from each column.\n","\n","2.

How do you check for missing values?\n","```\n",".isna() & .isnull()\n","\n","4. What is numpy?\n","```\n","NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.\n","\n","```\n","\n","5. Explain the difference between tidy and wide (summary) data.\n","```\n","your answer\n","```\n","\n","6. Explain the difference between categorical and quantitative data.\n","```\n","Categorical data consists of distinct categories or labels without any inherent order, such as colors, types of animals, or gender. It represents qualitative information. On the other hand, quantitative data is numerical and represents measurable quantities with a meaningful order, allowing for arithmetic operations. Examples of quantitative data include age, height, or income. The key distinction lies in the nature of the information: categories for categorical data and numerical values for quantitative data.\n","```\n","\n","7.
